      <h3>Success Stories </h3>
      <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6"> <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="images/mcdt3.jpg" alt="bulletin blog"> </div>
      <h4>1.The story of Bernard Mwambegu from ACK KAMA Gahaleni TG
</h4>
     
      <p>The Rise of ACK Kama Gahaleni TG: A Brotherhood of Savers and Investors
ACK KAMA Gahaleni Trust Group is a unique and inspiring story of men from the Kenya Anglican Men's Association coming together to break the mold. Traditionally, women have dominated saving groups in Kenyan society. However, these men, driven by a shared desire for financial security and prosperity, formed ACK KAMA Gahaleni TG with a singular focus: to save, invest, and create a credit pool to uplift themselves.</p>
 <p>In these very early days, this group exemplifies a powerful shift in mindset. Members consistently prioritize their weekly meetings, dedicating valuable time from their busy schedules to learn, save, and grow together. This commitment speaks volumes about their dedication to their collective financial well-being</p>
 <h4>Bernard Mwambegu: A Catalyst for Change</h4>
  <p>One member, Bernard Mwambegu, has emerged as a true champion for the group. His unwavering dedication to ensuring regular meetings and training sessions has been instrumental in their success. Mwambegu's own transformative journey resonates deeply with the group. He openly acknowledges the profound impact of Malindi Community Development Trust (MalCDT) on his financial literacy.</p>
  <p>"Since the MCDT staff came to us and we welcomed them," Mwambegu shared, "my understanding of finances has undergone a complete transformation. They have helped me clear the 'dirt' from my mind." By "dirt," Mwambegu poignantly refers to the past financial missteps and unwise decisions that plagued him before engaging with MalCDT.</p>
  <h4>A Bright Future: Saving, Investing, and Collective Growth</h4>
  <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6"> <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="images/mcdt4.jpg" alt="bulletin blog"> </div>
  <p>Inspired by his newfound financial acumen, Mwambegu has set ambitious personal savings goals for the year. He firmly believes that with the continued support and guidance of ACK KAMA Gahaleni CDT, he can achieve these goals and build a more secure future.
Furthermore, Mwambegu sees ACK KAMA Gahaleni TG as a powerful platform for collective growth. The group provides a safe and supportive space for men to share business ideas, explore investment opportunities, and collaborate on ambitious projects. One such initiative involves the collective purchase of land, a strategic investment that will yield long-term benefits for all members.</p>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>

  <p>ACK KAMA Gahaleni TG stands as a testament to the power of collective action and the transformative potential of financial education. By challenging traditional gender roles and embracing a proactive approach to financial management, these men are not only securing their own futures but also inspiring other men in their community to follow suit. Their story serves as a powerful reminder that financial empowerment is a journey best undertaken collectively, fostering a spirit of brotherhood and shared prosperity.</p>
  
  <h4>2.Zawadi Mwafungo An upcoming Soap Detergents Vendor </h4>
  <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6"> <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="images/mcdt5.jpg" alt="bulletin blog"> </div>
  <p>Her name is Zawadi Mwafungo, the Swahili name ‘Zawadi’ meaning ‘a gift.’ She is always welcoming, jovial and happy, she terms Malindi Community Development Trust program ‘a gift’ from God, her ever smiling face, full of hope brightens daily since she onboarded the ACK Mkenge CDT.</p>
  <p>A. Formation of ACK Mkenge TG: When the field officer visited Msabaha village in Malindi, she decided to visit the priest who pastored ACK Mkenge, she took sometime to sensitize her on what MalCDT entailed, the Priest was moved by what she heard and promised to mobilise her congregants to form a Trust Group, in a weeks’ time ACK Mkenge TG was already onboarded with 8 members, this number have however, grown to 17 members to date. This group comprises of women who have so far been trained on financial literacy.</p>
  <p>B. Eye Opener: ‘I can see, this is how I can make money through my small business’ Zawadi comments during one of the financial literacy trainings. She later saved KES 600 from some income she gets from housekeep expenses through his husband and daughter, surprisingly during the next meet up, Zawadi unveiled her Detergent Making business to the group members, she explained that she had already supplied some ten Liters of her product to a nearby academy, the proceeds had allowed her to buy raw chemicals for twenty Liters and doubled her savings from KES 200 monthly to KES 400 monthly. This was encouraging as she could now properly record her sales, calculate profits and she is now drawing an expansion plan of producing 40 Liters per week.</p>
  <p>C. Members thinking out of the box: From the Zawadi’s small business the ACK Mkenge TG members have started embracing small business ideas, almost 40% of the group members having started small businesses such as grocery, blending juice, Frying groundnuts. They have a common saying, ‘Kick out Poverty by all means’ this has greatly encouraged the MalCDT staff and an initiative of training some members on homemade yoghurt making venture is underway as these members have milk from their cows, adding value will help them harvest some good profits</p>
  <h4>Conclusion: </h4>
  <p>Zawadi stands out as an inspiring TG member who is biting all odds to ensure the ends meet and have something to save. Her goals are clear, she wants to become a soap producer when her savings will be able to support the venture. She plans to apply for a loan from the TG to expand her business as soon as possible. </p>
