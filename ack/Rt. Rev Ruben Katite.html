Robert Miles who paid the full fees for him through the Higher Diploma studies.  </p>
      <p>He did very well and managed to score a Distinction in the year 2008 which opened a door for a scholarship for him to do a Bachelor Degree with the University of South Africa (UNISA). He was not able to do the degree because he lacked the KCSE certificate.
